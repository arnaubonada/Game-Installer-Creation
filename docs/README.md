# Game Installer Creation
On this research you will find out what a game installer is and how to implement it in your own game. 

## Introduction
First of all, it is necessary to clarify what is meant when talking about installation. Starting with the installation of software, is the act of making the program ready for execution.
There are different processes of installing a piece of software. Because the process is different for each program and each computer, programs often come with an installer, a specialised program responsible for performing everything required for installation.
Installation generally involves code being copied or generated from the installation files to new files on the local computer. This is done for the following reasons:
- Makes easier access by the operating system.
- Creates all the necessary directories.
- Registers the environment variables.
- Provides a separate program for uninstallation, which involves more than just deleting the program folder, because there are registry files and other system code that may need to be modified or removed for a complete uninstall.

Users buy games because they enjoy playing them, not because they enjoy installing them. Installing a game should be as quick, straightforward, and as painless as possible for the end user. Ideally, end users should not even see an installation UI; they should be able to just drop the game disc into the tray and begin playing.
